Professional Development Plugin — Summary of Changes
October 13–26, 2025 (Branch: main)

Purpose
- Provide a clear, non-technical summary of what changed in the plugin between Oct 13 and Oct 26, 2025.

What Changed (Plain Language)
- Sessions page improvements: The “Add New Session” form now opens as a pop-up, is easier to use, and includes smarter fields (for example, looking up Presenters and handling a Parent Event field).
- Easier attendee management: After you add a session, the attendees area opens automatically so you can quickly add people.
- Better CEU handling: If a session does not qualify for CEUs, related options are hidden. When it does, the CEU weight can be based on the session length to reduce manual work.
- Clearer data in tables: The attendees list can show each person’s Certification Status when available. The Sessions table has smoother scrolling, improved sorting behavior, and a “Details” button.
- Stronger data connections: The Sessions and Members pages are more reliably connected to the database. Several behind‑the‑scenes services were added to support these features.
- Small fixes and polish: Wording like “Most recent session:” was corrected, and hours counting was adjusted for accuracy. Layout and formatting were tuned for readability.

What You Might Notice
- Add New Session opens in a pop‑up with clearer steps.
- After creating a session, the page prompts you to add attendees.
- You can search/select Presenters directly in the session form.
- The Sessions table scrolls horizontally for wide content and supports better sorting.
- Attendees can show a Certification Status in the list when available.
- CEU options adjust automatically based on your selections; CEU weight can auto‑calculate from session length.
