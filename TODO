## Later
- Evaluate Triggers for table updates.

## Ask Jason
- Ask Jaon if member status for a presentor should be acknoledged?

- Reguarding a possible BEFORE UPDATE trigger in administrative_service, ask Jason if a    
  person can server in two committies or two boards at the same time?

- For Administrative Service, can a person only ever serve on a Committie or Board?

- For attendees, does every attendee have a unique email and name? Can there be two members that share the same email?

# Completed

    userers taking over the recycled wordpress id's. 

- extract then prepare csv inserts for database.

- fix database to log first and last name of presenters.

- add proper presentor metadetails.

# Notes:
The front end administrative side is complete
The back end is almost complete, some buggs need ironing out
Whats left:
- the member fasing side to allow members to view the sessions they have attended.
- including a tool that allows data to be imported into the database.
